Design
	everytime we upload a document, we should be storing some of these important characteristics 
		{
			name:
			bucket:
			size: 
		}


We should also store a list of all possible buckets
	{
		buckets: ['ajsdkajsd', asdliajsd, sakhdhafa]
	}


Commands
	- cg <bucketname> 
		- requires a passcode as input
		- creates bucket with that name 
		- pushes that bucket name to the database within "buckets"
	
	- ls --bucket (gets all bucket names)
		- makes a query of all unique bucket names
		- lists that in the console

	- ls <bucket> (gets all files with that bucket)
		- checks for authentication
		- looks for all documents that share the same name as bucket
		- lists that in the console

	- upload <bucket> <file path>
		- asks for authentication

	- download <bucket> <file name> 
		- asks for authentication
	
	- deletes file
